# Banner ads app using Localazy's API
This is an example repository that uses Localazy's API to dynamically create Banner ads on the fly.

Feel free to download this repository and try it out. Just run
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

and open `http://localhost:3000/`

All the language data are then stored in [Banners-api project](https://localazy.com/p/banners-api).
